                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. <br><br>
                        Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

            <p>Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million.Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day.</p></div>

            <p class="text-start">The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-9">
            <p>The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe. During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium.By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.
                During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated.House cats often mate with feral cats. Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.</p>

                <p class="text-start">Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.[79] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision. Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.</p>

            <p class="left-align-text">The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices.</p>

                <p class="align-content-center">Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area, which is about twice that of humans.Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion.About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.</p>

            <p>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing)</p></div>

            <h2><strong>International Pet Ownership Comparisons</strong></h2>
                <p>Globally, around 57% of households own a pet, at
                   62%, Australians are more likely to have a pet than most
                   nationalities.
                   As shown in the graphic opposite from GfK Research,
                   Argentina (66%), Mexico (64%) and Brazil (58%) have the
                   highest proportions of dog owners. Russia (57%), France
                   (41%) and the USA (39%) have the higher percentages of
                   cat owners, while the Chinese have more fish (17%), and bird
                   ownership is highest in Turkey (20%).
                   As shown opposite, GfK’s research also reveals that
                   Australians’ ownership of pets in all categories in their study
                   – i.e. dogs, cats, fish, birds and other pets – exceeds the 22
                   country average; while the proportion of households with no
                   pets is below that average.
                   The table adjacent delivers insight into pet populations,
                   comparing New Zealand, the United States and United
                   Kingdom with Australia. These three countries have been
                   chosen due to their economic and cultural similarities to
                   Australia.
                   In recent years, the United States has overtaken New
                   Zealand to have the highest rate of pet ownership at 65% of
                   households, with New Zealand now at 64% and Australia at
                   62%. Ownership in the UK is far lower at 40%.
                   While the US has the highest proportion of households with
                   dogs (44%), New Zealand has the higher penetration of cats
                   (also 44%).</p></div>
